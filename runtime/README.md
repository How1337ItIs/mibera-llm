# Mibera Runtime - RTX 3080 Optimized

**High-quality Mibera model runner optimized for RTX 3080 GPUs.**

This branch contains everything needed to run Mibera with GPU acceleration - no research files or development artifacts.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (3 commands)

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch runtime https://github.com/How1337ItIs/mibera-llm.git
cd mibera-llm
./runtime/scripts/setup-3080.sh  # Installs CUDA + builds everything
```

Then run:
```bash
git lfs pull  # Download pre-quantized models
./llama-cli -m models/mibera-Q4_K_M.gguf -p "Hello! Introduce yourself as Mibera." -ngl 40
```

## ðŸ“‹ What's Included

- **Patched llama.cpp** - Fixed for Mibera's PHI4-style architecture
- **RTX 3080 setup script** - One-click CUDA installation + build
- **Pre-quantized models** - Q4_K_M (8.5GB), Q3_K_M (6.9GB), F16 (26GB)
- **Detailed docs** - See `docs/Ubuntu-3080-setup.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Settings

**RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM):**
- Use `mibera-Q4_K_M.gguf` for best balance of quality/speed
- `-ngl 40` to offload all layers to GPU  
- Expect 35+ tokens/second
