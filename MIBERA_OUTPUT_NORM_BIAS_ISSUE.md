# Mibera Output_Norm.Bias Issue Explained

## Executive Summary

The Mibera models fail to load in llama.cpp due to a missing `output_norm.bias` tensor. This is a compatibility issue between the model architecture and llama.cpp's expectations, not a corruption or conversion error.

## The Core Problem

```
Error: llama_model_load: error loading model: check_tensor_dims: tensor 'output_norm.bias' not found
```

### What's Actually Happening

1. **Model Architecture**: Mibera (Phi-4 variant) uses LayerNorm WITHOUT bias terms
2. **Conversion Process**: Correctly converts only tensors that exist (283 tensors total)
3. **Llama.cpp Expectation**: Expects ALL LayerNorm layers to have BOTH weight AND bias
4. **Result**: Model loading fails when bias tensor isn't found

## Technical Details

### Expected vs Actual Tensors

```
What llama.cpp expects for output normalization:
- output_norm.weight ✅ (exists)
- output_norm.bias   ❌ (missing - doesn't exist in original model)

What the model actually has:
- 283 tensors total
- All layer_norm layers have ONLY weights, NO biases
- This is correct for the Phi-4 architecture
```

### Why This Happens

The Phi-2/Phi-4 architecture was designed without bias terms in normalization layers for efficiency. This is a valid architectural choice, but llama.cpp's loader was written assuming all normalization layers would have bias terms.

## Impact on Different Quantizations

| Quantization | File Size | Issue Status | RAM Needed |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| F16 (base) | 28GB | Missing bias | 32GB+ |
| Q4_K_M | 8.5GB | Missing bias | 11-12GB |
| Q3_K_M | 6.9GB | Missing bias | 10-11GB |
| Q2_K | 5.2GB | Missing bias | 8-9GB |
| IQ2_XXS | ~3.5GB | Missing bias | 5-6GB |
| IQ1_S | ~2.5GB | Missing bias | 4-5GB |

**All quantizations inherit the missing bias issue from the base F16 conversion.**

## Why It's Difficult to Fix

### 1. Tensor Structure Already Set
- Quantized models have compressed the tensor data
- Can't easily add new tensors to existing GGUF files
- Would need to rebuild from source with modifications

### 2. Architecture Mismatch
- Original model legitimately doesn't have these bias tensors
- Adding fake bias tensors (all zeros) might work but is hacky
- Could affect model behavior unpredictably

### 3. Loader Expectations
- Llama.cpp's Phi-2 loader hardcodes the expectation of bias tensors
- Would need to modify llama.cpp source to make bias optional
- Or use different loader that's more flexible

## Current Workarounds Being Attempted

### 1. Ultra-Low Quantization (IQ1_S/IQ2_XXS)
**Goal**: Reduce model size so drastically it fits in available RAM
- IQ1_S: 1.56 bits per weight (~2.5GB total)
- IQ2_XXS: 2.06 bits per weight (~3.5GB total)
- **Status**: Still has missing bias issue

### 2. Alternative Inference Engines

#### ctransformers
```python
from ctransformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "mibera-Q2_K-final.gguf",
    model_type="phi",  # or "gpt2"
    gpu_layers=0,
    context_length=256
)
```
**Advantage**: More forgiving about model format differences

#### Ollama (with modifications)
- Already tried, requires too much RAM overhead
- Even Q2_K needs 8.9GB total

#### llamafile
- Single executable, potentially lower overhead
- Still uses llama.cpp internally, likely same issue

### 3. GGUF Surgery
**Concept**: Add fake bias tensors (all zeros) to satisfy loader
```python
# Pseudocode for adding missing bias
for layer in model.layers:
    if has_weight_but_no_bias(layer):
        add_zero_bias_tensor(layer)
```
**Challenge**: Complex due to GGUF format and quantization

### 4. Rebuild from Source
**Most Proper Solution**:
1. Modify the conversion script to add bias tensors during initial conversion
2. Convert HF model → F16 GGUF with fake biases included
3. Quantize the fixed F16 to Q2_K, IQ2_XXS, etc.
4. These quantized versions would include the bias tensors

## Recommended Solutions

### For Immediate Use (6.5GB RAM Available)

1. **Wait for IQ2_XXS quantization** on remote server
2. **Try ctransformers** with existing Q2_K model
3. **Use online inference** temporarily

### For Proper Fix

1. **Rebuild models on remote**:
   ```bash
   # Add bias tensors during conversion
   python convert_with_bias_fix.py
   ```

2. **Modify llama.cpp** to make bias optional:
   ```cpp
   // In llama.cpp loader
   if (tensor_exists("output_norm.bias")) {
       load_bias();  // Optional
   }
   ```

3. **Use different architecture flag** that doesn't expect bias

## The Analogy

Think of it like a regional power outlet difference:
- **Model**: European 2-pin plug (no ground)
- **Llama.cpp**: American 3-pin outlet (expects ground)
- **Issue**: Physically incompatible even though electrically similar
- **Fix**: Need an adapter (add fake ground) or different outlet (different loader)

## Conclusion

This is a fundamental compatibility issue between:
1. What the model architecture actually has (no bias in LayerNorm)
2. What llama.cpp expects (bias in all LayerNorm layers)

The model itself is fine - it's the loader that's too strict. The best solution is to either:
- Make the loader more flexible (modify llama.cpp)
- Make the model match expectations (add fake bias tensors)
- Use a different loader entirely (ctransformers, etc.)

Until then, even ultra-low quantizations like IQ1_S won't help because they inherit the same structural issue from the base model.
